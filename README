## How to use DART

1) Install dart

2) Start `/bin/dart-server.exe`, the server is atm started at `127.0.0.1:7777`

3) Connect with python scripts to the server, see examples

## Build DART in a docker Container

The docker images can be used to build manylinux variants of the dart-server and the gpispace workers.

0) Clone this repository an cd in it

1) Create a build environment image with `docker build -t dart_buildenv_x86_64 -f docker/Dockerfile-x86_64 docker`
  * This is going to need a long time, however this step is only required once
  
2) Build dart inside the container
  * Start a container with some name, e.g., `build`
  * Copy dart to the container, i.e., `docker cp . build:/build/dart/`
  * Build dart, install it, and zip it, i.e., `docker exec build bash /build/dart/docker/build_dart.sh`
  * Copy the builded archive out of the container, i.e., `docker cp build:dart.tar.gz dart_x86_64.tar.gz`
